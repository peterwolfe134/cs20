        <p>My favorite place is probably the hostel I worked at in SF. It's an incredibly welcoming place and I made great friends with many of our visitors. You can book a reservation <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/samesun-san-fransisco.html?aid=2417925&label=pmax-nGQL3hWQ3TuZyU4lyXmlfAS111111111111%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Anex%3Afi%3Ati%3Alp9002012%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm&sid=01afdc65fd53cb09ca835c286ad1a9b0&dest_id=20015732;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=1;hpos=1;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1726792941;srpvid=a6ce04f2fabb0625;type=total;ucfs=1&" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>When I was young, my favorite restaurant was the Rainforest Cafe. Sadly, the SF location closed many years ago. You can read about that <a href="https://hoodline.com/2017/10/after-17-years-rainforest-cafe-on-fisherman-s-wharf-shutters/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Something not many know about me was that when I was 14, I used to make Minecraft animations. My biggest project was a comission piece for a big channel that got over a million views. You can see it <a href="https://youtu.be/wU4p2LvSfRw?si=yzl6h2md0Kg1UQDr" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
    <small>...Since I'm allowed to put anything I want on this website, I would like to formally complain about my housemate who set off the fire alarm while I was working on this assignment. He misread the number "1 1/2" on a box of hot pockets and ended up microwaving one for <strong>11 minutes</strong>. Here is the result:</small>
